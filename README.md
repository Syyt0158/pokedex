# Pokedex
## Homepage
In this project we had to use an alpine. We had to make a website that looks like a pokedex. For this project we used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. When you open this site you can see the homepage.
Here you can see all the pokemons that we have taken out of the alpine. You can use the searchbar to find a specifik pokemon. You can type the name of the pokemon or the number and then you will see the pokemon your looking for!
When you click on the pokemon, you'll see the stats of this pokemon. When you click on the button on the right side, it will show you the evolution of that pokemon. And with the button on the left you'll go back.

## TV anime series
When you go to the navbar and click on the TV anime series you'll see a page with slides. If you scroll down you will be able to see 3 cards. One shows the series that isn't available yet. The 2nd card shows another series, and when you click on the button below it will bring you to a trailer on Youtube.
If you look at the 3th card you will see another series and when you click on more it will bring you to another page

## The "more" page on the card
When you click on more you will be in a page where you can find more info about this series. When you scroll down, you will be able to see pokemon characters from this series. When you click on them you'll be able to see more info about that character.

## Goods
If you scroll back to the navbar, you can click on goods. You will be able to see a shopping page with all the products. You can click on the items and you'll get more info about the product and you'll be able to see the picture a bit better.
If you want to buy this item you can go ahead and click on add to cart. Well because this was just a project you can't really buy this item, but it was a nice idea to make it like that

Well this was the site :)
